# Overview

Here I make comparisons of kelp canopy coverage in 1911 to current levels across the entire California coastline and within Northern, Central, and Southern regions. The tables and figures generated by this code are stored in `output/`.

# Setup
```{r packages}
library(here)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(rlist) # For list wrangling functions
library(furrr) # For parallel purrr
library(ggspatial) # For north arrow and scale bar
library(ggpubr) # For multipanel plots
library(paletteer)
```

# Load data

## Historical kelp coverage 

A quick look at the geodatabase of kelp coverage from 1911 indicates that area calculations for each polygon are already included. 
```{r load-historical}
kelp_historical <- st_read(here("raw", "CaliforniaKelp.gdb"))
glimpse(kelp_historical)
st_area(kelp_historical) # The areas for each polygon match the values in the "Shape_Area" column
```

## Current kelp coverage

Read in kelp coverage shapefiles from 1989, 1999, and 2002-2012 (*Note: There appear to be two files associated with 2010*). Add columns indicating the filename, year, and if it was a complete survey or not. According to the CDFW [website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/Kelp/Aerial-Kelp-Surveys), not all regions of California were covered in each annual survey. It appears the two most recent surveys included (2015 and 2016) did cover all regions:

```{r load-current, eval = FALSE}
(files <- list.files(here("raw"), pattern = "BIO.*\\.shp$", full.names = TRUE))
kelp_current <- map(files, st_read) # Note: this is a large (5.7 GB) object.
kelp_current <- map2(.x = kelp_current, .y = files, ~mutate(.x, 
                                                            file = basename(.y),
                                                            year = parse_number(file),
                                                            complete_survey = if_else(year %in% c(1989, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2015, 2016), TRUE, FALSE)))

glimpse(kelp_current[[1]])
```

# Inspect datasets

## Check CRS

Harmonize the coordinate reference systems used by converting the historical map to use the California Albers CRS.
```{r crs}
st_crs(kelp_historical)
st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])

kelp_historical <- st_transform(kelp_historical, st_crs(kelp_current[[1]]))
st_crs(kelp_historical) == st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])
```

## Make preliminary plots of the raw data

Make simple maps of each CDFW shapefile. Here I'll use  the `rnaturalearth` package to directly download a boundary of California from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/). 
```{r raw-maps}
ca_boundary <- rnaturalearth::ne_states(country = "United States of America", returnclass = "sf") %>% 
  filter(name == "California") %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])) # Harmonize the CRSs

kelp_survey_plots <- kelp_current %>%
  # Sort CDFW data by year
  rlist::list.sort(unique(year)) %>%
  # Plot CDFW kelp maps
  map(~ggplot() +
        geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, fill = NA) +
        geom_sf(data = ., fill = "forestgreen", color = "forestgreen") +
        labs(title = .$file) +
        theme_void()
  ) %>%
  # Plot 1911 kelp map
  rlist::list.prepend(
    ggplot(kelp_historical) +
      geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, fill = NA) +
      geom_sf(fill = "forestgreen", color = "forestgreen") +
      labs(title = "Digitized 1911 map") +
      theme_void()
  )

# Save
pdf(here("output", "fig_annual_kelp_survey_plots.pdf"), height = 11, width = 8.5)
ggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = kelp_survey_plots, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
dev.off()
```

Make slightly more detailed map of raw 1911 data. Note that the southernmost part of the shapefile extends outside California, so I will trim that out later.
```{r raw-map-hist}
pal <- "RColorBrewer::Greens"
density_levels <- c("Very heavy", "Heavy", "Medium heavy", "Reported", "Medium", "Thin", "Very thin")

(plot_1911 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, size = 0.1, fill = "ivory2") +
  geom_sf(data = kelp_historical, size = 1.1, aes(color = factor(Kelp, levels = density_levels), fill = factor(Kelp, levels = density_levels))) +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", style = "ticks") + # Scale bar
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", pad_y = unit(.8, "cm"), height = unit(.4, "cm"), width = unit(.4, "cm")) +
  scale_fill_paletteer_d(palette = pal, direction = -1) +
  scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = pal, direction = -1) +
  labs(fill = "Density", 
       color = "Density",
       caption = "Scale of kelp areas exaggerated for clarity") +
  theme_void()
)

# ggsave(here("output", "fig_kelp_map_1911.pdf"), height = 6, width = 6, dpi = 300)
# Is there a potential bug here? Something strange is going on when I save the figure as a pdf.
# Instead of appearing as a polygon, the kelp layers show up as hollow points. 
# Look into this

ggsave(here("output", "fig_kelp_map_1911.png"), height = 6, width = 6, dpi = 300)
```

# Segment into regions

I'm going to make comparisons of kelp coverage over time for the entire California coastline as well as by region. To do so, I first need to segment the kelp data into Northern, Central, and Southern regions. A shapefile of the California coastline (provided by C. Scarborough) will serve to define each region.

```{r get-coastline}
ca_coastline <- st_read(here("raw", "cc_coastline_hires_3nmi", "cc_coastline_hires_3nmi.shp")) 

# Quick look
ca_coastline %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = region_cod)) +
  theme_void()

# Transform CRS and remove Oregon and Washington areas
(ca_coastline <- ca_coastline %>% 
  st_transform(st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(region_cod, "^CA"))
)
```

Next, segment the kelp surveys into the three regions. I'll also trim out the data outside of California in the historical map.
```{r segment-data}
# Historical

# kelp_historical_crop <- st_crop(kelp_historical, st_bbox(ca_boundary))
# "Evaluation error" -- st_buffer() and st_cast() solution gleaned from SO...

kelp_historical_regions <- kelp_historical %>% 
  st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON") %>% 
  st_buffer(0) %>% 
  st_crop(st_bbox(ca_boundary)) %>% 
  st_join(select(ca_coastline, region_cod))

# CDFW
# Note: This takes a while (~20 min) to run.
future::plan(multisession(workers = 4))
tictoc::tic()
kelp_current_regions <- kelp_current %>% 
  # future_map(., ~st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON")) %>% 
  # future_map(., ~st_buffer(0)) %>% 
  future_map(~st_join(., select(ca_coastline, region_cod)), .progress = TRUE)
tictoc::toc()
```

Save, so the segmentation code does not have to be run again.
```{r save-segmented-data}
st_write(kelp_historical_regions, dsn = here("processed", "CaliforniaKelp_regions.gpkg"))
walk(kelp_current_regions, 
    ~st_write(.x, 
              dsn = here("processed", paste0(unique(tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(.x$file))), "_regions.gpkg"))))
```

# Comparisons of kelp area

## Calculate total kelp area

I need to do some wrangling of the column names in the CDFW data since the `area`, `length`, `class`, and `kelp_bed` (polygon id) variables have different names depending on the file you are looking at.
```{r drop-geometry}
# Drop geometry and convert to data frame. Coalesce columns where needed
kelp_current_df <- map(kelp_current_regions, st_drop_geometry) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  mutate(area = coalesce(Shape_Area, Area),
         length = coalesce(Shape_Leng, Length),
         class = coalesce(Class_Name, Class_name),
         class = coalesce(class, Type),
         kelp_bed = coalesce(KelpBed, as.integer(KELPBED))) %>% 
  select(-Shape_Area, -Area, -Shape_Leng, -Length, -Class_Name, -Class_name, -Type, -KelpBed, -KELPBED)
head(kelp_current_df) # Check df structure
kelp_current_df %>% map_dbl(~sum(is.na(.))) # Check for NAs

kelp_historical_df <- st_drop_geometry(kelp_historical_regions)
```

Because the methods for each data source differ (multispectral imagery vs. vessel-based visual surveys), the CDFW and Cameron (1915) data are liked biased in different directions. The CDFW data is comprised of many small, high-resolution polygons, whereas the historical data is compromised of polygons with very large areas and no holes. Therefore, the historical data likely overestimates the actual kelp canopy area since it is likely that density is heterogeneous within each polygon. We can adjust the area of the historical polygons based on Table XXI from Cameron (2015) which contains kelp weights per square yard for each density class. The values from the table are below. Also of note is that there is another class recorded in Cameron (2015) without any density information, named "Reported," but this class makes up only 5/245 (2%) of kelp observations in the dataset. 

| Density class  | *Nereocystis* | *Macrocystis* | *Alaria fistulosa* |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Very thin      | 55          | 22          | 2.8              |
| Thin           | 56-111      | 23-34       | 2.9-5.2          |
| Medium         | 112-167     | 35-44       | 5.5-8.2          |
| Medium heavy   | 168-224     | 45-54       | 8.3-10.9         |
| Heavy          | 225-280     | 55-64       | 11-13.6          |
| Very Heavy     | 281         | 65          | 13.7             |


For the purposes of this work, we will only consider *Nereocystis* and *Macrocystis*, since *A. fistulosa* is not distributed in California (is this right). For classes with ranges, we will use the average.
```{r adjust-historical-area}
kelp_weights <- read_csv(here("raw", "cameron_1915_kelp_weights.csv"))

kelp_weights <- kelp_weights %>% 
  # Rescale the Nero and Macro weights by dividing by the maximum
  mutate(nereo_rescaled = Nereo/max(Nereo),
         macro_rescaled = Macro/max(Macro)) %>% 
  # For the "reported" class, let's assume it is the average of the weights for each species
  add_row(Class = "Reported",
          nereo_rescaled = mean(.$nereo_rescaled),
          macro_rescaled = mean(.$macro_rescaled)) %>% 
  # We assume the kelp is a mix of these two spp, so take the average rescaled value
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(mean_kelp_weight = mean(c(nereo_rescaled, macro_rescaled))) %>% 
  rename(nereo_lbs_per_yd2 = Nereo,
         macro_lbs_per_yd2 = Macro) %>% 
  write_csv(here("processed", "kelp_weights_for_scaling.csv"))


```


Next I'll filter the CDFW survey data to only the kelp marked as "canopy" (vs. "subsurface"), and calculate total canopy area per year per region for all surveys. Any surveys without a classification are assumed to be of the kelp canopy. Additionally, I'll denote which CDFW survey years were complete surveys, based on the bar graph on their website (linked above).
```{r calc-ts}
unique(kelp_current_df$class)
area_ts <- kelp_current_df %>% 
  filter(!class %in% c("subsurface", "Subsurface", "Kelp Subsurface")) %>%  #  Remove observations of subsurface kelp
  group_by(year, region_cod) %>%
  summarize(total_area_m2 = sum(area)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  union( # Append the historical data
    kelp_historical_df %>% 
      group_by(region_cod) %>% 
      summarize(total_area_m2 = sum(Shape_Area)) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      mutate(year = 1911)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(complete_survey = if_else(year %in% c(1911, 1989, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2015, 2016), TRUE, FALSE),
         source = if_else(year == 1911, "Cameron 1915", "CDFW 2020")) %>% 
  arrange(year, region_cod)

# Make a wide version for the manuscript that includes the total
area_ts_wide <- area_ts %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "region_cod", values_from = "total_area_m2") %>% 
  mutate(total = CA1 + CA2 + CA3) %>% 
  relocate(complete_survey, .after = last_col()) %>% 
  relocate(source, .after = last_col())

# Add total to the long version
area_ts <- area_ts_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("CA1", "CA2", "CA3", "total"), names_to = "region", values_to = "total_area_m2") %>% 
  select(year, region, total_area_m2, complete_survey, source)
```

Save the tables:
```{r save-tables}
write_csv(area_ts, here("output", "annual_kelp_area.csv"))
write_csv(area_ts_wide, here("output", "annual_kelp_area_wide.csv"))

area_ts_wide %>% 
  filter(complete_survey == TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(Northern = CA1/1e6,
         Central = CA2/1e6,
         Southern = CA3/1e6,
         Total = total/1e6) %>% 
  select(-complete_survey,
         -CA1,
         -CA2,
         -CA3,
         -total) %>% View
```  

Plot a quick time series.
```{r plot-ts}
# Plot
ggplot(data = filter(area_ts, region == "total"), aes(x = year, y = total_area_m2/1e6, fill = complete_survey)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray50", "black"), labels = c("Incomplete survey", "Complete survey")) +
    labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Total kelp area (sq. km)",
       title = "Kelp area time series",
       fill = NULL) +
  cowplot::theme_minimal_hgrid() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

ggsave(here("output", "fig_ca_kelp_time_series.png"), height = 6, width = 9, dpi = 300)
```

## Calculate area changes

What is the difference between the area of kelp coverage in 1911 and that of the most recent year(s) of data?
```{r calc-area-changes}
# Delta
(sum(kelp_historical_df$Shape_Area) -
sum(kelp_current_df$area[kelp_current_df$year == 2016])
) / 1e6 # sq. km

# %
(sum(kelp_historical_df$Shape_Area) -
sum(kelp_current_df$area[kelp_current_df$year == 2016])
) / sum(kelp_historical_df$Shape_Area) * 100

```

## Plot changes between 1911 and 2016

A few different plot options:
```{r}
region_pal <- "wesanderson::Darjeeling1"
year_pal <- calecopal::cal_palette("sbchannel", n = 10, type = "continuous")

# Dodged bar plot of area per region, all years

  ggplot(aes(x = region, y = total_area_m2/1e6, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(y = "Kelp canopy area (sq. km)",
       fill = "Year",
       x = NULL) +

  filter(year != 1911) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop_loss, color = region)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray80") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +

       color = NULL) +
  ggpubr::theme_pubr() +

```


## Plot maps of historical vs. current coverage

First make a map of the overall coastline.
```{r plot-total-maps}
# First do the same filtering of subsurface kelp, but on the polygon. 
# Since I think we'll be primarily showing the 1911 data vs. the 2016,
# I'm just going to subset the 2016 data

kelp_2016 <- kelp_current_regions %>% 
  keep(~unique(.x$year) == 2016) %>% 
  pluck(1) %>% 
  filter(!Class_Name %in% c("subsurface", "Subsurface", "Kelp Subsurface"))

# Full coastline

(a <- ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, size = 0.1, fill = "ivory2") +
    geom_sf(data = kelp_historical_regions,  aes(fill = region_cod, color = region_cod), size = 0.7) +
    annotation_scale(location = "bl", style = "ticks") + # Scale bar
    annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", pad_y = unit(.8, "cm"), height = unit(.4, "cm"), width = unit(.4, "cm")) +
    labs(subtitle = "1911",
         fill = NULL, 
         color = NULL) +
    scale_fill_paletteer_d(region_pal,  labels = labs) +
    scale_color_paletteer_d(region_pal,  labels = labs) +
    theme_void()
)

b <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, size = 0.1, fill = "ivory2") +
    geom_sf(data = kelp_2016, aes(fill = region_cod, color = region_cod), size = 0.7) +
    labs(subtitle = "2016",
         fill = NULL, 
         color = NULL) +
    scale_fill_paletteer_d(region_pal,  labels = labs) +
    scale_color_paletteer_d(region_pal,  labels = labs) +
    theme_void()

ggpubr::ggarrange(a, b, 
                  nrow = 1, 
                  align = "hv", 
                  labels = "AUTO", 
                  common.legend = TRUE,
                  legend = "right")

ggsave(here("output", "fig_kelp_map_1911_vs_2016.png"), height = 6, width = 8, dpi = 300)
```

Next, make two "highlight" maps of sites in Northern and Southern CA. 
```{r}
