Overview
========

Here I make comparisons of kelp canopy coverage in 1911 to current
levels across the entire California coastline and within Northern,
Central, and Southern regions. The tables and figures generated by this
code are stored in `output/`.

Setup
=====

    library(here)
    library(sf)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(rlist) # For list wrangling functions
    library(furrr) # For parallel purrr
    library(ggspatial) # For north arrow and scale bar
    library(ggpubr) # For multipanel plots
    library(paletteer)

Load data
=========

Historical kelp coverage
------------------------

A quick look at the geodatabase of kelp coverage from 1911 indicates
that area calculations for each polygon are already included.

    kelp_historical <- st_read(here("raw", "CaliforniaKelp.gdb"))
    glimpse(kelp_historical)
    st_area(kelp_historical) # The areas for each polygon match the values in the "Shape_Area" column

Current kelp coverage
---------------------

Read in kelp coverage shapefiles from 1989, 1999, and 2002-2012 (*Note:
There appear to be two files associated with 2010*). Add columns
indicating the filename, year, and if it was a complete survey or not.
According to the CDFW
[website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/Kelp/Aerial-Kelp-Surveys),
not all regions of California were covered in each annual survey. It
appears the two most recent surveys included (2015 and 2016) did cover
all regions:

    (files <- list.files(here("raw"), pattern = "BIO.*\\.shp$", full.names = TRUE))
    kelp_current <- map(files, st_read) # Note: this is a large (5.7 GB) object.
    kelp_current <- map2(.x = kelp_current, .y = files, ~mutate(.x, 
                                                                file = basename(.y),
                                                                year = parse_number(file),
                                                                complete_survey = if_else(year %in% c(1989, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2015, 2016), TRUE, FALSE)))

    glimpse(kelp_current[[1]])

Inspect datasets
================

Check CRS
---------

Harmonize the coordinate reference systems used by converting the
historical map to use the California Albers CRS.

    st_crs(kelp_historical)
    st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])

    kelp_historical <- st_transform(kelp_historical, st_crs(kelp_current[[1]]))
    st_crs(kelp_historical) == st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])

Make preliminary plots of the raw data
--------------------------------------

Make simple maps of each CDFW shapefile. Here I’ll use the
`rnaturalearth` package to directly download a boundary of California
from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).

    ca_boundary <- rnaturalearth::ne_states(country = "United States of America", returnclass = "sf") %>% 
      filter(name == "California") %>% 
      st_transform(st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])) # Harmonize the CRSs

    kelp_survey_plots <- kelp_current %>%
      # Sort CDFW data by year
      rlist::list.sort(unique(year)) %>%
      # Plot CDFW kelp maps
      map(~ggplot() +
            geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, fill = NA) +
            geom_sf(data = ., fill = "forestgreen", color = "forestgreen") +
            labs(title = .$file) +
            theme_void()
      ) %>%
      # Plot 1911 kelp map
      rlist::list.prepend(
        ggplot(kelp_historical) +
          geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, fill = NA) +
          geom_sf(fill = "forestgreen", color = "forestgreen") +
          labs(title = "Digitized 1911 map") +
          theme_void()
      )

    # Save
    pdf(here("output", "fig_annual_kelp_survey_plots.pdf"), height = 11, width = 8.5)
    ggpubr::ggarrange(plotlist = kelp_survey_plots, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
    dev.off()

Make slightly more detailed map of raw 1911 data. Note that the
southernmost part of the shapefile extends outside California, so I will
trim that out later.

    pal <- "RColorBrewer::Greens"
    density_levels <- c("Very heavy", "Heavy", "Medium heavy", "Medium", "Reported", "Thin", "Very thin")

    (plot_1911 <- ggplot() +
      geom_sf(data = ca_boundary, size = 0.1, fill = "ivory2") +
      geom_sf(data = kelp_historical, size = 1.1, aes(color = factor(Kelp, levels = density_levels), fill = factor(Kelp, levels = density_levels))) +
      annotation_scale(location = "bl", style = "ticks") + # Scale bar
      annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", pad_y = unit(.8, "cm"), height = unit(.4, "cm"), width = unit(.4, "cm")) +
      scale_fill_paletteer_d(palette = pal, direction = -1) +
      scale_color_paletteer_d(palette = pal, direction = -1) +
      labs(fill = "Density", 
           color = "Density",
           caption = "Scale of kelp areas exaggerated for clarity") +
      theme_void()
    )

    # ggsave(here("output", "fig_kelp_map_1911.pdf"), height = 6, width = 6, dpi = 300)
    # Is there a potential bug here? Something strange is going on when I save the figure as a pdf.
    # Instead of appearing as a polygon, the kelp layers show up as hollow points. 
    # Look into this

    ggsave(here("output", "fig_kelp_map_1911.png"), height = 6, width = 6, dpi = 300)

Segment into regions
====================

I’m going to make comparisons of kelp coverage over time for the entire
California coastline as well as by region. To do so, I first need to
segment the kelp data into Northern, Central, and Southern regions. A
shapefile of the California coastline (provided by C. Scarborough) will
serve to define each region.

    ca_coastline <- st_read(here("raw", "cc_coastline_hires_3nmi", "cc_coastline_hires_3nmi.shp")) 

    # Quick look
    ca_coastline %>% 
      ggplot() +
      geom_sf(aes(fill = region_cod)) +
      theme_void()

    # Transform CRS and remove Oregon and Washington areas
    (ca_coastline <- ca_coastline %>% 
      st_transform(st_crs(kelp_current[[1]])) %>% 
      filter(str_detect(region_cod, "^CA"))
    )

Next, segment the kelp surveys into the three regions. I’ll also trim
out the data outside of California in the historical map.

    # Historical

    # kelp_historical_crop <- st_crop(kelp_historical, st_bbox(ca_boundary))
    # "Evaluation error" -- st_buffer() and st_cast() solution gleaned from SO...

    kelp_historical_regions <- kelp_historical %>% 
      st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON") %>% 
      st_buffer(0) %>% 
      st_crop(st_bbox(ca_boundary)) %>% 
      st_join(select(ca_coastline, region_cod))

    # CDFW
    # Note: This takes a while (~20 min) to run.
    future::plan(multisession(workers = 4))
    tictoc::tic()
    kelp_current_regions <- kelp_current %>% 
      # future_map(., ~st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON")) %>% 
      # future_map(., ~st_buffer(0)) %>% 
      future_map(~st_join(., select(ca_coastline, region_cod)), .progress = TRUE)
    tictoc::toc()

Save, so the segmentation code does not have to be run again.

    st_write(kelp_historical_regions, dsn = here("processed", "CaliforniaKelp_regions.gpkg"))
    walk(kelp_current_regions, 
        ~st_write(.x, 
                  dsn = here("processed", paste0(unique(tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(.x$file))), "_regions.gpkg"))))

Comparisons of kelp area
========================

Time series of total kelp area
------------------------------

Additionally, I need to do some wrangling of the column names in the
CDFW data since the `area`, `length`, `class`, and `kelp_bed` (polygon
id) variables have different names depending on the file you are looking
at.

    # Drop geometry and convert to data frame. Coalesce columns where needed
    kelp_current_df <- map(kelp_current_regions, st_drop_geometry) %>% 
      bind_rows() %>% 
      mutate(area = coalesce(Shape_Area, Area),
             length = coalesce(Shape_Leng, Length),
             class = coalesce(Class_Name, Class_name),
             class = coalesce(class, Type),
             kelp_bed = coalesce(KelpBed, as.integer(KELPBED))) %>% 
      select(-Shape_Area, -Area, -Shape_Leng, -Length, -Class_Name, -Class_name, -Type, -KelpBed, -KELPBED)
    head(kelp_current_df) # Check df structure
    kelp_current_df %>% map_dbl(~sum(is.na(.))) # Check for NAs

    kelp_historical_df <- st_drop_geometry(kelp_historical_regions)

Next I’ll filter the CDFW survey data to only the kelp marked as
“canopy” (vs. “subsurface”), and calculate total canopy area per year
per region for all surveys. Any surveys without a classification are
assumed to be of the kelp canopy. Additionally, I’ll denote which CDFW
survey years were complete surveys, based on the bar graph on their
website (linked above).

    unique(kelp_current_df$class)
    area_ts <- kelp_current_df %>% 
      filter(!class %in% c("subsurface", "Subsurface", "Kelp Subsurface")) %>%  #  Remove observations of subsurface kelp
      group_by(year, region_cod) %>%
      summarize(total_area_m2 = sum(area)) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      union( # Append the historical data
        kelp_historical_df %>% 
          group_by(region_cod) %>% 
          summarize(total_area_m2 = sum(Shape_Area)) %>% 
          ungroup() %>% 
          mutate(year = 1911)
      ) %>% 
      mutate(complete_survey = if_else(year %in% c(1911, 1989, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2015, 2016), TRUE, FALSE),
             source = if_else(year == 1911, "Cameron 1915", "CDFW 2020")) %>% 
      arrange(year, region_cod)

    # Make a wide version for the manuscript that includes the total
    area_ts_wide <- area_ts %>% 
      pivot_wider(names_from = "region_cod", values_from = "total_area_m2") %>% 
      mutate(total = CA1 + CA2 + CA3) %>% 
      relocate(complete_survey, .after = last_col()) %>% 
      relocate(source, .after = last_col())

Save the tables:

    write_csv(area_ts, here("output", "annual_kelp_area.csv"))
    write_csv(area_ts_wide, here("output", "annual_kelp_area_wide.csv"))

    area_ts_wide %>% 
      filter(complete_survey == TRUE) %>% 
      mutate(Northern = CA1/1e6,
             Central = CA2/1e6,
             Southern = CA3/1e6,
             Total = total/1e6) %>% 
      select(-complete_survey,
             -CA1,
             -CA2,
             -CA3,
             -total) %>% View

Plot a quick time series.

Plot maps of historical vs. current coverage
--------------------------------------------

First make a map of overall

    # First do the same filtering of subsurface kelp, but on the polygon.

Calculate area changes
----------------------

Overall
-------

What is the difference between the area of kelp coverage in 1911 and
that of the most recent year(s) of data?

    # Delta
    (sum(kelp_historical_df$Shape_Area) -
    sum(kelp_current_df$area[kelp_current_df$year == 2016])
    ) / 1e6 # sq. km

    # %
    (sum(kelp_historical_df$Shape_Area) -
    sum(kelp_current_df$area[kelp_current_df$year == 2016])
    ) / sum(kelp_historical_df$Shape_Area) * 100
